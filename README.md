## Datalad

## Used for nested looping and getting the x,y index in a matrix
np.unravel_index(tile_idxs, [row_num, col_num])

## Checking connectivity issues to a computer
```
ping IPADDRESS --- if this works and the below says filtered, then there is a network block
sudo nmap -p 22 -Pn --traceroute IPADDRESS
```
also nslookup is helpful to return the ip address of a named computer <br>
On the local computer --- sudo ufw status -- this may show any local firewall filtering that is occuring <br>

## Twine upload to pypi
To fix the following issue with setuputils uploade, download twine to 6.0.1 (from 6.1.0): https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79408101/what-is-the-correct-way-of-specifying-the-license-in-pyproject-toml-file-for-a-n


### Sphinx setup (still learning this)
`pip install sphinx` <br>
`pip install sphinxcontrib-napoleon` <br>

Add the following to the conf.py file :
```
import os, sys
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('..'))

```

Run 
```
cd ..
sphinx-apidoc -o docs .
sphinx-build -b html ./ ./html
```
